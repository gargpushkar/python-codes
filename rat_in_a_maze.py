# Rat In A Maze
# You are given a maze in the form of a matrix of size n * m. Each cell is either clear or blocked denoted by 1 and 0 respectively.
# A rat sits at the top-left cell and there exists a block of cheese at the bottom-right cell. Both these cells are guaranteed to be clear.
# You need to find if the rat can get the cheese if it can move only in one of the two directions - down and right. It canâ€™t move to blocked cells.
