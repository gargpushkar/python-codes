# Longest Increasing Subsequence
# Given an array A, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (LIS).

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements such that the order of the remaining elements remain the same.

# Example
# A: [10, 20, 2, 5, 3, 8, 8, 25, 6]
# Result: 4
# Explanation: Longest increasing subsequence: [2, 5, 8, 25]

A = [10, 20, 2, 5, 3, 8, 8, 25, 6]

# n =
